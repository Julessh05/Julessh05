# Hi üëãüèº

I'm Julian Schumacher, an 19 year old student at DHBW-Stuttgart, building and improving my
coding skills.


## About me

I'm a student at DHBW-Stuttgart with special interest in technic and coding. \
But mostly I'm still developing my skills in my free time and on my own.


## My Work

### Development

Currently I'm developing native apps for Apple devices using Swift and Swift UI. \
I'm also developing apps and packages with Google's Flutter framework and the underlying language Dart. \
Along with that, I'm improving my native Android development skills with Kotlin.

## UI / UX

I've also got some experience in user interface and user experience design, both with Apple's [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/guidelines/overview/) and Google's [Material 3](https://m3.material.io) UI and UX design systems.



## My Setup

### Hardware

I'm the minimalistic type of person, so I only use my MacBook for development.  

MacBook:
- 2020 MacBook Air
- M1 CPU with 8 CPU cores and 7 GPU cores
- 256 GB of storage
- 16 GB of unified RAM

For testing I use the Android emulator that comes with Android Studio and the IOS simulator that comes with Xcode


### Software

I'm using a lot of different software to develop my apps:
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) for iOS and macOS apps (Swift, SwiftUI, ...)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) for Android apps (Kotlin, Java, XML, ...)
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com)
- [Penpot](https://penpot.app)


## Organizations

I created a few organizations to sort, manage and group my projects. \
The Jules Media organization contains nearly all my Flutter packages and plugins. \
The school Organization contains all the stuff we are doing in school. (kinda obvious)


## Contact

I'm always happy to hear from you, so if you got any questions, you can reach me via [E-mail](mailto:professional@julianschumacher.dev).
