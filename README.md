# Hi üëãüèº

I'm Julian Schumacher, an 19 year old Student at Philipp-Matth√§us-Hahn School, building and improving my
Coding skills.


## About me

I'm a Student at a Gymnasium with special interest in Technic and Coding. \
But mostly I'm still developing my Skills in my free Time and on my own.


## My Work

### Development

Currently I'm developing native Apps for Apple devices using Swift and Swift UI. \
I'm also developing Apps and Packages with Google's Flutter Framework and the underlying Language Dart. \
Along with that, I'm improving my native Android development skills with Kotlin.

## UI / UX

I've also got some experience in User Interface and User Experience Design, both with Apple's [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/guidelines/overview/) and Google's [Material 3](https://m3.material.io) UI and UX Design Systems.



## My Setup

### Hardware

I'm the minimalistic type of person, so I only use my MacBook for development.  

MacBook:
- 2020 MacBook Air
- M1 CPU with 8 CPU Cores and 7 GPU Cores
- 256 GB of Storage
- 16 GB of unified RAM

For Testing I use the Android Emulator that comes with Android Studio and the IOS Simulator that comes with Xcode


### Software

I'm using a lot of different Software to develop my Apps:
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) for iOS and macOS Apps (Swift, SwiftUI, ...)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) for Android Apps (Kotlin, Java, XML, ...)
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com)
- [Penpot](https://penpot.app)


## Organizations

I created a few Organizations to sort, manage and group my Projects. \
The Jules Media Organization contains nearly all my Flutter Packages and Plugins. \
The School Organization contains all the stuff we are doing in school. (kinda obvious)


## Contact
