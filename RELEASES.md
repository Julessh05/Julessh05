## About Releases

I am using the Github Release Section of a Repository to release my Apps.

This way anyone can download and use them.

## Available OS

Currently the following Operating Systems are available on Github Releases:

- Android (APKs)
- Mac (.app) (On supported Apps)


Not available:

- IOS (because you can only install Apps from the App Store)
- Windows (because you need a Windows Host to compile these Apps)
- Linux (because you need a Linux Host to compile these Apps)

## Release Notes

My newer Projects all have a RELEASE_NOTES.md File, in which you can see all the new Features and Bugfixes in a specific Release.
